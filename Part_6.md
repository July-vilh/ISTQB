# =================  SDLC  =============

1. SEQUENTIAL (ПОСЛЕДОВАТЕЛЬНЫЙ)

We have sequents of steps (test planning. design, execution)

## ================   SEQUENTIAL MODEL   ==============

* describes the software development process as A LINER SEQUENTIAL FLOW of activities
* any phase in the development process should BEGIN WHEN THE PREVIOUS PHASE IS COMPLETE!
* to have EARLY FEEDBACK from the following phase

## =================  INCREMENTAL DEVELOPMENT ================

* Involves establishing (установленные) requirements, designing, buildingand testing a system in pieces which means that the software's feautures grow incrementally
* the sixe of these feature increments with some methods = having LARGER PIECES and some SMALLER PIECES
* The feature increments can be as small as a single change to a user interface screen or new query option

## ================= ITERATIVE DEVELOPMENT =====================

* Occurs when groups of features are specified, designed, built and tested TOGETHER in a series of cycles, often of a fixted duration
* TIMING it is about ITERATIVE MODEL
* Iterations may involve changes to to features in early iterations
* Each iteration delivers working software which is a growing subject
