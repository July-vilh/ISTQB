---------------------------------------------  Characteristics of good testing

1) For every development activity there is a CORRESPONDING TEST ACTIVITY

* Every developing activity must be corresponding test activity
___________

2) Each test levels has test objectives specific to this level
_________________

3) Test analysis and design for a given test level begin during the corresponding development activity

- While developers write code I should write test scenarious and test cases

- We should write test cases when we gathering the requirements 

____________________

4) Testers participate in discussions to define and refine requirements and design 

- Are involved in rewieving work products

- You should review the requirements, you should review the design, you should review the the goals, review the final product
