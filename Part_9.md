## TEST LEVELS

* Test levels = are groups of test activities that are organized and managed together
* Each test level is an instance of the test process
* Test levels are related to other activities within the software development lifecycle

### LEVELS:

#### 1. COMPONENT level
#### 2. INTEGRATION level
#### 3. SYSTEM level
#### 4. ACCEPTANCE level

### Test levels are charactarized by the following attributes:

* Specific oblectives
* Test basis, referenced to derive test cases
* Test object (what is being tested)
* Typical defects and failures
* Specific approaches and responsibilities

### ANOTHER rules:

* for every test level = a suitable environment is required

## 1) COMPONENT (UNIT) TESTING

Component (Unit) testing = focuses on components that are separately testable

### 1.1. OBJECTIVES 

Reduce risk-find defects-prevent defects escape-verify behavior-Build confidence

### 1.2. TEST BASIS

Detailed Design-code-data Model-Component specification

### 1.3. Responsibility = developer (+ TDD)

> TDD ( Test Driven Development) = developing automated test cases, than building and integrating small pieces of cod, then executing the component tests. correcting any issues and re-dactoring the code

### 1.3. TEST OBJECTS

Components- Units - Modules - Code - Data - Structures - Classes - DB Models
