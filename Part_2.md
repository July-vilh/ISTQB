# 7 Testing Principles: #
## 1. Testing shows the presence of defects. Not their absence. ##
Presence = наличие

Absence = отсутствие

We can not proof that there are no defects in our software.
___
# Second Principle of Testing: #

## Exhaustive testing is impossible. ##

Testing everything is not feasible except for trivial cases (yes/no)

feasible except  = осуществимо за исключением (синоним слова FEASIBLE = POSSIBLE)

* TESTING EVERYTHING IS NOT POSSIBLE EXCEPT FOR TRIVIAL CASES (YES/ NO)

ExHaustive = Исчерпывающее

Feasible = Осуществимо
___
# Third principle of testing: #

## Early testing saves time and money ##

To find defects early, both static and dynamic test activities should be started as early as possible
___
# 4 Principle of Testing: #

## Defects cluster together. ##

Cluster = группировка

A small number of modules usually contains most of the defects discovered during pre-release testing

Большое количество багов находится в небольшом (но главном/смоук модуле)

Этот принцип схож с законом Парето (80/20):

20% modules may contains 80% defects
___
# 5 Principle of testing: #

## Beware of Pesticide Paradox. ##

If the same tests are repeated over and over again, these tests no longer find any new defects.

BEWARE = остерегаться (СИНОНИМ СЛОВА BEWARE = AVOID)

* AVOID OF PESTICIDE PARADOX

Test cases on something functionality should be contains new scenarious for these test cases.

Exisiting tests and test data may need changing and new tests may need to be written.
___
# 6 Principle of testing: #

## Testing is Context dependent. ##

Testing is done differently in different context

Testing in an Agile project is done differently than testing in sequential (последоват.) software development lifecycle project.

sequential = последовательность
___
# 7 Principle of testing: #

## Absence of error is a fallacy. ##

It is a fallacy ro expect that just finding and fixing a large number of defects will ensure the success of system.

to expect = ожидать

will ensure = будет гарантировать
