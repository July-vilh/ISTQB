### Test Monitoring and Control ###

#### - Monitoring is on-going comparison of actual progress against the test plan using any test monitoring defined in the test plan. ####

I write 1000 test-cases each month. I planning write 2000 test cases. And I comparison actual result against test plan.

#### - Taking actions  to meet the objectives of the test plan. ####

#### - Supported by Exit Criteria (Criteria, that define: we finished this activity) or DOD (from Agile): Definition of Done. It is all about Control Activity. ####

Control is based on monitoring activities. In order to monitor my progress take the correct actions.

In the control activities consist Exit Criteria.

#### - Test progress against the plan is communicated to stakeholders in test progress reports. ####
